[EVALUATION]

    - Suspend a client (^-Z) connected to a channel. Then flood the channel with another client. This
should not freeze. When the client is active again, all stored commands should be processed normally; check
for memory leaks during this operation. <<<<--- THIS NEEDS A FULL REFACTOR

    - With nc, When attempting with a bad command and then using a good one, it loops twice
    (first does not recognize the command)

    - Once done everything, we need to check into the cluster computer
        to check with valgrind :D
