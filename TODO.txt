SERVER:

[CHANNEL MANAGER]
    - Right now the JOIN command manages the addition to channels,
        it does not go through the channel manager, 
        not a good design but functional
    - PING / PONG necessary, because if not, irssi disconnects


[EVALUATION]
    - Check everything without address sanitizer, then with it
    - Right now there is a weird behavior when using the IRSSI client

    - Suspend a client (^-Z) connected to a channel. Then flood the channel with another client. This
should not freeze. When the client is active again, all stored commands should be processed normally; check
for memory leaks during this operation. <<<<--- THIS NEEDS A FULL REFACTOR
    - Check for operations from a regular user and operator user
    
    - Once done everything, we need to check into the cluster computer
        to check with valgrind :D 

- [END] Remove the scripts
