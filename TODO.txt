SERVER

    - [DONE] [NEED CHECKING] Error replies -> 2 that are left, are done in the server logic
            --> NOSUCHNICK and NOSUCHCHANNEL (why Sveta has it?)
    - Error replies --> There are some that need access to the AParserResult, and sometimes they give a memory problem
                        Dont know how to handle it 



[EVALUATION]

    - Suspend a client (^-Z) connected to a channel. Then flood the channel with another client. This
should not freeze. When the client is active again, all stored commands should be processed normally; check
for memory leaks during this operation. <<<<--- THIS NEEDS A FULL REFACTOR

    - [DONE] File descriptors --> It seems like it has been corrected
    - I think there is something in the "QUIT" command, sometimes it gives error
    
    - [DONE] Check the mode command to fix the bug that Sveta said <<--- Changes on line 136 and later
        ---> it works BUT because we store 2 'o's (+o and -o), the reply contain both,
            and it is not very pretty
    - [DONE] When only one guy in the channel, mandatory to be operator <--- Changes made in channel class
