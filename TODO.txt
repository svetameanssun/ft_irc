SERVER

    - [DONE] [NEED CHECKING] Error replies -> 2 that are left, are done in the server logic
            --> NOSUCHNICK and NOSUCHCHANNEL (why Sveta has it?)



[EVALUATION]

    - Suspend a client (^-Z) connected to a channel. Then flood the channel with another client. This
should not freeze. When the client is active again, all stored commands should be processed normally; check
for memory leaks during this operation. <<<<--- THIS NEEDS A FULL REFACTOR

    - I do not know why file descriptors appear as open again;
        we solved this but it seems like we did not
    - I think there is something in the "QUIT" command, sometimes it gives error
    
    - [DONE] [NEED CHECKING] Check the mode command to fix the bug that Sveta said <<--- Changes on line 136 and later
    - [DONE] [NEED CHECKING] When only one guy in the channel, mandatory to be operator <--- Changes made in channel class
