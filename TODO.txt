SERVER

    - Ruben: I've added 2 files (hpp and cpp) to reply with proper error messages depending on the 
        non-valid ret that I receive from you. I would need to know exactly which error rets I can
        get so I can cover all the cases ;D 



[EVALUATION]

    - Suspend a client (^-Z) connected to a channel. Then flood the channel with another client. This
should not freeze. When the client is active again, all stored commands should be processed normally; check
for memory leaks during this operation. <<<<--- THIS NEEDS A FULL REFACTOR


    - Once done everything, we need to check into the cluster computer
        to check with valgrind :D
