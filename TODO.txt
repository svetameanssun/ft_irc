    - [IN PROGRESS] Error replies -> 2 need to be implemented; 2 need to be corrected



[EVALUATION]

    - Suspend a client (^-Z) connected to a channel. Then flood the channel with another client. This
should not freeze. When the client is active again, all stored commands should be processed normally; check
for memory leaks during this operation. <<<<--- THIS NEEDS A FULL REFACTOR


    - Once done everything, we need to check into the cluster computer
        to check with valgrind :D 

    - I do not know why file descriptors appear as open again;
        we solved this but it seems like we did not
    - Check the mode command to fix the bug that Sveta said
    - [DONE] [NEED CHECKING] When only one guy in the channel, mandatory to be operator
