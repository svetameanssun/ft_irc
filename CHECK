1) check the consistency of the parameters returned in the classes derived from AParcerResult.
      should I return a vector with the whole command  --> vector<string> vec = {"JOIN", "#channel"};
                                                                              OR
      only a vector with command params                --> vector<string> vec = {"JOIN", "#channel"};
