*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by* **<stitovsk>**, **<regea-go>**

## Description

This project aims to provide an understanding of how the TCP/IP layer works by using the UNIX socket API to create a functional IRC server compatible with official IRC clients.

## Instructions

To compile the project, a Makefile is provided.  
Use the `make` command to compile it.

To run the project, several commands are available:

- `make run`: executes the server with predefined `<port>` and `<password>`
- `make valgrind`: executes the server and logs Valgrind checks to detect memory errors and/or open file descriptors
- `make valgrind_logs`: logs both Valgrind errors **and** the custom logs generated by the server, depending on the operations performed

## Resources

As a reference for the implementation of the IRC server, we have almost exclusively used the RFCs related to the IRC protocol, such as:

- RFC 1459 (May 1993)
- RFC 2811 (April 2000)
- RFC 2812 (April 2000)

For the networking part, several YouTube resources were used to understand the UNIX networking API and its underlying concepts.

*AI Usage*

AI tools were used throughout all stages of the project:

- At the beginning, to find resources related to the IRC protocol, define the initial project structure, and divide the work among the students.
- Later, to assist with architectural changes within the server, specifically regarding the distribution of responsibilities among the different server modules.
- AI was also used to validate the logic of the IRC commands, as each command requires a specific sequence of checks to ensure correctness.
- For the networking part, AI was used to verify the correct configuration steps of the socket layer and to ensure proper client–server communication using the `poll()` function, allowing multiple users to connect without blocking.
- It was also used to ensure the correct transmission of information between the server and the clients.
